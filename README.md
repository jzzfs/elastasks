## Background
Inspired by a [closed Kibana github issue](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/42621):

> Long-running tasks can leak processes and kill a cluster. Users need a way to detect slow queries and kill these tasks. We can start down the road of addressing this problem by building a “Tasks” app that show a list of all tasks that are running, indicate ones that are cancellable, display any available information that the API provides, and give users the ability to cancel these tasks.
